- Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- Add tests for new features
- Document public APIs with `///` comments

---

### Commit Messages

- Be descriptive: "Add YAML support" not "Update code"
- Reference issues: "Fix #123: Handle empty files"

---

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update README if adding user-facing features
- Describe what changed and why
- More tests are always welcome for merging!

---

### Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues first
- Provide minimal reproduction case
- Use markdown code blocks for code/errors
